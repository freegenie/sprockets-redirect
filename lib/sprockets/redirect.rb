module Sprockets
  # A Rack middleware for Rails >= 3.1.0 with asset pipeline and asset digest
  # enabled. This middleware is used to redirect any request to static asset
  # without a digest to the version with digest in its filename by reading the
  # manifest.yml file generated after you run rake assets:precompile
  #
  # For example, if a browser is requesting this URL:
  #
  #   http://example.org/assets/application.js
  #
  # They will get redirected to:
  #
  #   http://example.org/assets/application-faa42cf2fd5db7e7290baa07109bc82b.js
  #
  # This middleware is designed to run on your staging or production environment,
  # where you already precompile all your assets, turn on your asset digest, and
  # turn of asset compilation. This is useful if you're having a static page or
  # E-Mail which refers to static assets in the asset pipeline, which might be
  # impossible and impractical for you to use an URL with a digest in it.
